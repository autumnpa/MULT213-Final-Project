# Description
MULT213 & COMP264 Final Project

This is an interactive webpage that generates an affirmation from an API. We have designed it with default styling as well as two unique stylesheets for our individual themes. Themes can be toggled between with a button click input from the user. The user can use the other buttons to generate a randomized theme using two other API's to fetch images and fonts if preset themes are not desired.
